          <h2>üìΩÔ∏è Group Presentation</h2>
          <p>
            I created a presentation to showcase all the visual and branding work our group developed throughout the project. The goal was to clearly present our stylescapes, moodboards, logo, website design, and brand guide in a way that felt connected and professional.<br>
            I used Canva to build the presentation and made sure the layout followed our brand identity‚Äîusing the same fonts, colors, and tone we had defined. Each slide walked the viewer through a different part of our process, explaining not just the final product, but also how we got there.<br>
            We used this presentation to explain our design decisions, like why we chose certain colors or shapes, how the stylescape influenced the website layout, and how our tone of voice was reflected across the project. It helped tie all the pieces together and gave a clear overview of what we built as a team.<br><br>

          </p>

          <hr class="section-divider" />

          <h2>üé® Brand Guide Contribution</h2>
          <p>
            I contributed to several parts of our Brand Guide, especially the tone of voice, color palette decisions, and the icons & shapes page. These elements helped define how our brand looks, sounds, and feels‚Äîand we used them throughout our designs in Figma, the website, and our presentation materials.<br><br>
          </p>

            <h3>Color Palette</h3>
            <p>
              The color palette was a group effort. We had already chosen our main colors together as a team, but I helped finalize how they would be used across different elements. I focused on making sure the combinations had enough contrast for readability and accessibility. I checked how the colors worked in different backgrounds and tested them in real use (like buttons, text, and shapes) to make sure nothing got lost visually.<br>
              We made sure the palette reflected our tone: creative, soft, and playful, but still professional. We also looked at how the palette could layer well and work across both dark and light areas of the design.<br><br>
            </p>

            <h3>Tone of Voice</h3>
            <p>
              I was responsible for writing the tone of voice section in the guide. I researched examples from real branding guides and adapted them to fit how we wanted to present ourselves: professional but friendly, creative but respectful.<br>
              I also wrote small examples of how this tone would show up across different platforms‚Äîwhether in emails, social media posts, or in the website itself. This made it easier for the whole team to stay consistent when writing anything for the project.<br><br>
            </p>

          <h3>Icons & Shapes Page</h3>
            <p>
              I helped Adeline with the icons and shapes section too. She designed the visuals, and I supported her by figuring out the rules for placement and spacing. We wanted to make sure the use of shapes didn‚Äôt feel random, so I helped define a simple structure‚Äîlike how far apart shapes should be spaced, how they should align, and how to keep everything consistent across screens. That structure helped turn a cool design into something usable and repeatable.<br><br>
            </p>

          <h3>Reflection:</h3><p>Working on the Brand Guide made me realize how much thought goes into the small stuff. I used to think brand design was mostly about picking colors and fonts, but I‚Äôve learned it‚Äôs way more layered than that. Every little thing‚Äîlike how shapes are placed or how friendly the writing sounds‚Äîcan shape how someone sees the whole project. I also saw how important it is to keep things clear and well-documented. Honestly, at first I wasn‚Äôt super confident writing the tone of voice section‚ÄîI kept wondering if it made sense to others or if I was overcomplicating it. But after sharing it with the group and seeing them actually use it, I felt more confident in what I wrote. Helping define the shape layout rules with Adeline also reminded me that structure can be creative too. Next time, I‚Äôd take more time to double-check how each decision fits into the bigger picture, instead of assuming it just ‚Äúworks.‚Äù This process helped me see how structured design thinking and feedback really improve the final result.</p>
        
          <hr class="section-divider" />

          <h2>üí° Double Diamond ‚Äì Krom Project</h2>
          <p>
            Together with Adeline, I was responsible for applying the Double Diamond design method to guide the structure of our Krom project. We wanted to make sure our design choices weren‚Äôt just based on what looked good, but on real needs, research, and testing. We combined the Double Diamond with CMD tools to explore the challenge in a structured and creative way.<br><br>
          </p>

            <h3>Discover</h3>
            <p>
              We started by interviewing Studio Krom to understand their goals and expectations. From there, we dove into research on dyslexia, especially how it affects reading and comprehension. We also looked into the target audience: people without dyslexia, but who would use our tool to experience what it feels like. That insight really helped shape how we framed the rest of the project.<br><br>
            </p>
            
            <h3>Define</h3>
            <p>
              In this phase, i created personas based on the audience we were designing for. We also mapped out the different types of dyslexia and explored how each could potentially be translated into a visual or interactive effect. This part was especially important, because we needed to make sure we were being accurate and respectful, not just creative. We made choices based on scientific sources.<br><br>
            </p>

            <h3>Develop</h3>
            <p>
              Once we had a clear direction, we started experimenting with concepts. We tried different ways to visually simulate dyslexia, like distortion, word movement, spacing errors, and tested these internally to see which ones actually gave users that ‚ÄúI get it now‚Äù moment. We gathered feedback, made changes, and kept adjusting until the effects felt both impactful and understandable.<br><br>
            </p>

            <h3>Deliver</h3>
            <p>
              We took the most effective concepts and turned them into a working prototype. We ran quick user tests to see how people responded. Did they understand the message, and did the experience actually make them reflect on what dyslexia feels like?<br><br>
            </p>

            <h3>My Role & Reflection</h3>
            <p>
              This whole process pushed me to justify both visual and technical decisions in a way I hadn‚Äôt done before. It wasn‚Äôt enough to say something ‚Äúlooked better‚Äù, I had to explain why it worked, how it supported the concept, and how it would affect users.<br>
              It also taught me to balance empathy and creativity. Some ideas felt exciting visually, but didn‚Äôt really communicate the experience in the right way or worse, came across as too abstract or confusing. I had to learn when to let go of those and stay grounded in the purpose of the project.<br>
              Looking back, I‚Äôm proud that we didn‚Äôt just build a project that looked good, we created something based on real insights, made with real people in mind.<br><br>
            </p>

            <hr class="section-divider" />

          <h2>MoSCoW Table</h2>
          <p>
            To keep our project realistic and focused, we used the MoSCoW method to figure out which features were the most important‚Äîand which ones we could skip. It helped us avoid overcomplicating things and made sure we spent time on what actually mattered for the user experience.<br><br>
          </p>

            <h3>Must Have</h3>
            <p>
              The main goal was to let people experience what reading with dyslexia can feel like. So we knew from the start that we had to include:<br><br>
              ‚Ä¢	Text that was visually challenging, using distortion or effects<br>
              ‚Ä¢	A way to change the difficulty, so users could feel different levels of impact<br><br>
              Without these two, the whole point of the website wouldn‚Äôt come through.<br><br><br>
            </p>

            <h3>Should Have</h3>
            <p>
              We also really wanted a scoring system‚Äîsomething simple to give users feedback and make the whole thing feel a bit more game-like. It wasn‚Äôt essential, but it added something valuable.<br><br><br>
            </p>

            <h3>Could Have</h3>
            <p>
              Some fun ideas came up during brainstorming, like online multiplayer or custom lobbies. We loved the thought, but it just wasn‚Äôt realistic with the time we had. We saved these as ‚Äúmaybe in the future‚Äù ideas.<br><br><br>
            </p>

            <h3>Won‚Äôt Have</h3>
            <p>
              We also made it clear what we weren‚Äôt going to do, like:<br><br>
              ‚Ä¢	User accounts<br>
              ‚Ä¢	Matchmaking<br>
              ‚Ä¢	Leaderboards<br><br>
              These just didn‚Äôt fit the goal of the project. We weren‚Äôt building a competitive platform, our focus was on awareness and empathy, not scores or ranking.<br><br>
            </p>

            <hr class="section-divider" />

          <h2>üé™ Project Showcase</h2>
          <p>
            We had an event to showcase the progress of our project so far. For our table setup, we prepared a poster, our Figma prototype, and a working visual demo of the gameplay mechanics. It was really nice to present it all together and see how people responded.<br><br>
            We received a lot of positive feedback, especially about the color palette and how we managed to include both the gameplay experience and a small informative section. The part people seemed to like the most was the slider on the info page, which lets users adjust the strength of the shaders. It gave them a better idea of how different levels of distortion can impact people with dyslexia.<br><br>
            I also used the event as a chance to test the gameplay layout again. A few classmates stopped by and gave me helpful feedback. They both preferred the horizontal layout, saying it was clearer and easier to follow. I then asked Pennie to try it as well‚Äîshe said the vertical layout was a bit too much and actually gave her a headache, while the horizontal one felt more natural.<br>
            Dirk was the only one who chose the individual screen layout, where only one paragraph and its question/answers are shown at a time. He explained that it might help users stay more focused and move through the game faster.<br><br>
            After gathering all this feedback, I shared it with the team and we agreed to stick with the horizontal layout. It was what most people preferred‚Äîand honestly, it felt better to us too.<br><br>
            After showing our work, I also took some time to visit other groups and test their projects. I really enjoyed seeing what everyone came up with and hearing the ideas behind them. My favorites were the ‚ÄúFriends With Benefits‚Äù game and ‚ÄúBOND.‚Äù<br>
            The FWB game made me laugh‚Äîit was super awkward in a funny way. I suggested they tweak the answer system so that both people answer at the same time and then see the result together, instead of one person going first.<br>
            ‚ÄúBOND‚Äù was also super fun. I loved the mystery vibe and their paper prototypes were really well thought out. I usually enjoy mystery games, so it‚Äôs no surprise I liked it. My only feedback for them was to maybe add more characters to stretch out the game and make it even more immersive.<br><br>
          </p>

          <hr class="section-divider" />

          <h2>üìö Research on dyslexia</h2>
          <p>
            For this project, I tried to be really thoughtful about how I did my research, both when working on my own and with the team. We followed the Double Diamond method, which helped us split the project into four parts: understanding the problem, defining what we wanted to do, coming up with ideas, and testing them.<br><br>
            In the beginning, I looked into what dyslexia actually is, how it affects people, and how it could be shown in a digital experience. I used reliable websites, real articles, and design case studies to learn more. I wanted to make sure I wasn‚Äôt just guessing, but actually basing my ideas on facts. I focused a lot on how people with dyslexia read and what kind of tools or designs help them most.<br><br>
            We also involved Studio Krom, our client, early in the process. We asked questions and listened to what they wanted the final product to do. This helped us shape the direction of the whole project and made sure we weren‚Äôt designing something just for ourselves.<br><br>
            As we went on, I tested parts of the website with teachers and classmates, especially the layout. Their feedback really helped shape what the final version looked like. I didn‚Äôt just test once, I kept adjusting things when people told me something felt off.<br><br>
            Throughout the project, I also tried to keep in mind sensitive topics. Dyslexia is a real challenge for a lot of people, and we didn‚Äôt want to turn it into just a visual effect or a ‚Äúcool idea.‚Äù We tried to make something meaningful that created awareness in a respectful way. I also thought about how different people might see things differently, whether because of culture, experience, or background.<br><br>
            Doing all this taught me that research isn‚Äôt just about Googling stuff. It‚Äôs about listening, testing, and being open to change.<br><br>
