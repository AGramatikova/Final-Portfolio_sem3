          <div class="email-content">Each one of the group members wrote our strengths and weaknesses in the Team Charter. I have noticed in previous group works I solve problems easily and calmly, for me communication is key when working with others and I try to implement  that as much as possible, I do find myself creative because of the ideas I constantly come up with. I do get distracted easily and find it hard to focus immediately, a don’t like the present in front of a lot of people because I get nervous and could forget key stuff.

          <div class="email-title">Art Department Visit – Strip-S, March 20th:</div>
          <div class="email-content">I had the opportunity to visit the Art Department event at Strip-S. I went in with no specific expectations since I had never attended anything like this before, but that quickly changed the moment I stepped in and saw all the creative stands.<br>
            I explored every single one and found myself genuinely inspired. One of the highlights for me was the cardboard craft section. The level of detail and skill involved was impressive. Watching the artists cut, shape, and glue pieces together into intricate forms was fascinating.<br>
            I also really enjoyed browsing through the independent design booths, where artists showcased their original creations. The 3D dragon designs were definitely my favorite, but I also loved the variety of stickers featuring popular memes and original artwork.<br>
            Another standout moment for me was trying sculpting for the first time. I spent quite a bit of time working on a portrait and had great conversations with the artists there. They guided me through the sculpting process, explained the tools, and made it a really enjoyable learning experience.<br>
            The Film Academy's props display was yet another highlight, the quality and realism of the props they showcased was seriously impressive.<br>
            Lastly, I really appreciated the portfolio stands, where artists were friendly and welcoming. They even let me draw on their digital tablets and gave me helpful feedback on what looked good and how to improve.<br>
            Overall, the event was incredibly inspiring, and I left feeling very happy and motivated. I would recommend to people around me to visit whenever it opens again.</div>

          <div class="email-title">Career day</div>
          <div class="email-content">Going to the Career Day at TQ on April 17 was honestly more useful than I expected. I wasn’t really there to check out company booths—I was mainly focused on figuring out what specialization I want to take next semester. I’ve been going back and forth on a few, so I saw this as a good chance to finally get some clarity.</div>

          <div class="email-title">Personal Updates</div>
          <div class="email-content">•	As a shy and with social anxiety person I have pushed myself to be as open as possible with my group, express what I do not think is correct or what I think is better in the situation. I have also went to people in my class to ask for user testing. Although I have done some steps into improving myself I still struggle a lot with going to teachers for feedback. It is indeed my main priority at the moment.</div>

          <div class="email-title">Project Showcase</div>
          <div class="email-content">We had an event to showcase the progress of our project so far. For our table setup, we prepared a poster, our Figma prototype, and a working visual demo of the gameplay mechanics. It was really nice to present it all together and see how people responded.<br>
            We received a lot of positive feedback, especially about the color palette and how we managed to include both the gameplay experience and a small informative section. The part people seemed to like the most was the slider on the info page, which lets users adjust the strength of the shaders. It gave them a better idea of how different levels of distortion can impact people with dyslexia.<br>
            I also used the event as a chance to test the gameplay layout again. A few classmates stopped by and gave me helpful feedback. They both preferred the horizontal layout, saying it was clearer and easier to follow. I then asked Pennie to try it as well—she said the vertical layout was a bit too much and actually gave her a headache, while the horizontal one felt more natural.<br>
            Dirk was the only one who chose the individual screen layout, where only one paragraph and its question/answers are shown at a time. He explained that it might help users stay more focused and move through the game faster.<br>
            After gathering all this feedback, I shared it with the team and we agreed to stick with the horizontal layout. It was what most people preferred—and honestly, it felt better to us too.<br>
            After showing our work, I also took some time to visit other groups and test their projects. I really enjoyed seeing what everyone came up with and hearing the ideas behind them. My favorites were the “Friends With Benefits” game and “BOND.”<br>
            The FWB game made me laugh—it was super awkward in a funny way. I suggested they tweak the answer system so that both people answer at the same time and then see the result together, instead of one person going first.<br>
            “BOND” was also super fun. I loved the mystery vibe and their paper prototypes were really well thought out. I usually enjoy mystery games, so it’s no surprise I liked it. My only feedback for them was to maybe add more characters to stretch out the game and make it even more immersive.</div>
