          <div class="email-content">As part of the Team Charter, we each shared our strengths and weaknesses.<br>
            From past group projects, I’ve realized that I usually stay calm when problems come up and can find solutions without panicking. I really value good communication and always try to keep things clear and open with the team. I also see myself as a creative person — I enjoy coming up with new ideas and thinking outside the box.<br><br>
            On the other side, I do get distracted pretty easily, and it sometimes takes me a while to fully focus.<br>
            I also get nervous when I have to present in front of a big group, which can make me forget what I want to say.<br><br>
            These are things I’m working on, and I hope to keep improving as we go through this project.

          <div class="email-title">Art Department Visit – Strip-S, March 20th:</div>
          <div class="email-content">I had the opportunity to visit the Art Department event at Strip-S. I went in with no specific expectations since I had never attended anything like this before, but that quickly changed the moment I stepped in and saw all the creative stands.<br><br>
            I explored every single one and found myself genuinely inspired.<br>
            One of the highlights for me was the cardboard craft section. The level of detail and skill involved was impressive. Watching the artists cut, shape, and glue pieces together into intricate forms was fascinating.<br><br>
            I also really enjoyed looking through the independent design booths, where artists showcased their original creations. The 3D dragon designs were definitely my favorite, but I also loved the variety of stickers featuring popular memes and original artwork.<br><br>
            Another standout moment for me was trying sculpting for the first time. I spent quite a bit of time working on a portrait and had great conversations with the artists there. They guided me through the sculpting process, explained the tools, and made it a really enjoyable learning experience.<br><br>
            The Film Academy's props display was yet another highlight, the quality and realism of the props they showcased was seriously impressive.<br><br>
            Lastly, I really appreciated the portfolio stands, where artists were friendly and welcoming. They even let me draw on their digital tablets and gave me helpful feedback on what looked good and how to improve.<br><br>
            Overall, the event was incredibly inspiring, and I left feeling very happy and motivated. I would recommend to people around me to visit whenever it opens again.

          <div class="email-content">Going to the Career Day at TQ on April 17 was honestly more useful than I expected. I wasn’t really there to check out company booths—I was mainly focused on figuring out what specialization I want to take next semester. I’ve been going back and forth on a few, so I saw this as a good chance to finally get some clarity.

          <div class="email-content">As a shy and with social anxiety person I have pushed myself to be as open as possible with my group, express what I do not think is correct or what I think is better in the situation. I have also went to people in my class to ask for user testing. Although I have done some steps into improving myself I still struggle a lot with going to teachers for feedback. It is indeed my main priority at the moment.</div>

          <div class="email-title">Project Showcase</div>
          <div class="email-content">At first, I had a completely different vision for my portfolio.<br>
            I wanted something bold, with glowing colors, gradients, and a black background to make everything pop.<br>
            I was really inspired by thermo-style illustrations and searched Pinterest to collect ideas that matched that vibe.<br>
            I picked out the ones that felt the strongest to me and started designing based on that.<br><br>
            But as I kept working on it, something didn’t feel right.<br>
            Even though the idea was cool, I didn’t feel connected to it. It didn’t really represent me or the message I wanted my portfolio to give off.<br><br>
            That’s when I took a step back and started scrolling through a design account I’ve been following for a while.<br>
            I came across a few different styles, but one that really stood out was a desktop screen-inspired layout.<br>
            That idea felt more personal and fun to me. So I searched again on Pinterest, this time with a clearer vision, and collected a few more references around the desktop style.<br><br>
            In the end, I combined my favorite elements into one layout that felt creative but also true to me.<br><br>
            <strong>Feedback:</strong> During the third portfolio review, I received really positive feedback from both Chris and Medhat. They said the new design felt fun and interesting, and encouraged me to keep going with it. Chris pointed out that the Learning Outcome pages didn’t match the homepage in terms of style—and I completely agreed.<br>
            I explained that those were still the old versions and that I was planning to redesign them to match the desktop theme. After the review, I went ahead and did exactly that. Updating the pages to match the new style made the whole portfolio feel much more consistent and intentional.<br><br>
          <strong>Reflection:</strong> This part of the process taught me that design isn’t just about having a cool idea, t’s about making sure everything connects. My first concept looked good on its own, but it didn’t really feel like me, and I started to lose interest while working on it.<br>
          Changing direction was honestly the best decision I made.<br><br>
          After switching to the desktop layout, I finally felt excited about the design again. It reflected my personality and made the whole portfolio feel more playful and original.<br>
          But I also realized through feedback from Chris and Medhat that I had overlooked something important: consistency. They pointed out that my Learning Outcome pages didn’t match the homepage, and they were totally right, but I did explain they were still from the old design.<br>I’m glad I was able to take that feedback and fix it right away. Looking back, I learned not just how to design, but how to step back, reflect, and actually listen to both myself and others.  <br><br>
