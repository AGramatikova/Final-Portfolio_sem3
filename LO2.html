      <h2>üé® Brand Guide Contribution</h2>
      <p>
        I contributed to several parts of our Brand Guide, especially the tone of voice, color palette decisions, and the icons & shapes page. These elements helped define how our brand looks, sounds, and feels‚Äîand we used them throughout our designs in Figma, the website, and our presentation materials.<br><br>
      </p>

        <h3>Color Palette</h3>
        <p>
          The color palette was a group effort. We had already chosen our main colors together as a team, but I helped finalize how they would be used across different elements. I focused on making sure the combinations had enough contrast for readability and accessibility. I checked how the colors worked in different backgrounds and tested them in real use (like buttons, text, and shapes) to make sure nothing got lost visually.<br>
          We made sure the palette reflected our tone: creative, soft, and playful, but still professional. We also looked at how the palette could layer well and work across both dark and light areas of the design.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Tone of Voice</h3>
        <p>
          I was responsible for writing the tone of voice section in the guide. I researched examples from real branding guides and adapted them to fit how we wanted to present ourselves: professional but friendly, creative but respectful.<br>
          I also wrote small examples of how this tone would show up across different platforms‚Äîwhether in emails, social media posts, or in the website itself. This made it easier for the whole team to stay consistent when writing anything for the project.<br><br>
        </p>

      <h3>Icons & Shapes Page</h3>
        <p>
          I helped Adeline with the icons and shapes section too. She designed the visuals, and I supported her by figuring out the rules for placement and spacing. We wanted to make sure the use of shapes didn‚Äôt feel random, so I helped define a simple structure, like how far apart shapes should be spaced, how they should align, and how to keep everything consistent across screens. That structure helped turn a cool design into something usable and repeatable.<br><br>
        </p>

      <h3>Improvements:</h3>
      <p>
        - I spent extra time testing the color combinations in real design elements like buttons and backgrounds to make sure nothing got lost visually. That helped improve the overall accessibility and polish of our designs.<br>

        - I stepped out of my comfort zone by writing the full tone of voice section, even though I wasn‚Äôt sure how it would be received. Seeing the team actually use it gave me confidence and made the project feel more cohesive.<br>

        - While supporting Adeline, I helped define spacing rules for the shapes, which added clarity to something that could‚Äôve felt random. That structure turned a creative idea into something consistent and usable across screens.<br>

        - I also learned to pay more attention to documentation ‚Äî not just designing, but making sure the ideas were clearly explained so others could actually apply them.<br><br>
      </p>
      <h3>Reflection:</h3>
      <p>
        Working on the Brand Guide made me realize how much thought goes into the small stuff. I used to think brand design was mostly about picking colors and fonts, but I‚Äôve learned it‚Äôs way more layered than that. Every little thing‚Äîlike how shapes are placed or how friendly the writing sounds‚Äîcan shape how someone sees the whole project. I also saw how important it is to keep things clear and well-documented. Honestly, at first I wasn‚Äôt super confident writing the tone of voice section‚ÄîI kept wondering if it made sense to others or if I was overcomplicating it. But after sharing it with the group and seeing them actually use it, I felt more confident in what I wrote. Helping define the shape layout rules with Adeline also reminded me that structure can be creative too. Next time, I‚Äôd take more time to double-check how each decision fits into the bigger picture, instead of assuming it just ‚Äúworks.‚Äù This process helped me see how structured design thinking and feedback really improve the final result.</p>

      <h2>ü§ù Client Communication</h2>
      <p>
      Maintaining communication with the client was crucial. I stepped in to organize meetings when our team leader wasn‚Äôt available, directly messaging the client and coordinating availability. These efforts ensured we didn‚Äôt fall behind and had ongoing input and feedback from the client throughout.<br>
      </p>
    
      <hr class="section-divider" />

      <h2>üí° Double Diamond ‚Äì Krom Project</h2>
      <p>
        Together with Adeline, I was responsible for applying the Double Diamond design method to guide the structure of our Krom project. We wanted to make sure our design choices weren‚Äôt just based on what looked good, but on real needs, research, and testing. We combined the Double Diamond with CMD tools to explore the challenge in a structured and creative way.<br><br>
      </p>

        <h3>Discover</h3>
        <p>
          We started by interviewing Studio Krom to understand their goals and expectations. From there, we dove into research on dyslexia, especially how it affects reading and comprehension. We also looked into the target audience: people without dyslexia, but who would use our tool to experience what it feels like. That insight really helped shape how we framed the rest of the project.<br><br>
        </p>
        
        <h3>Define</h3>
        <p>
          In this phase, i created personas based on the audience we were designing for. We also mapped out the different types of dyslexia and explored how each could potentially be translated into a visual or interactive effect. This part was especially important, because we needed to make sure we were being accurate and respectful, not just creative. We made choices based on scientific sources.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Develop</h3>
        <p>
          Once we had a clear direction, we started experimenting with concepts. We tried different ways to visually simulate dyslexia, like distortion, word movement, spacing errors, and tested these internally to see which ones actually gave users that ‚ÄúI get it now‚Äù moment. We gathered feedback, made changes, and kept adjusting until the effects felt both impactful and understandable.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Deliver</h3>
        <p>
          We took the most effective concepts and turned them into a working prototype. We ran quick user tests to see how people responded. Did they understand the message, and did the experience actually make them reflect on what dyslexia feels like?<br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>My Role & Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          This whole process pushed me to justify both visual and technical decisions in a way I hadn‚Äôt done before. It wasn‚Äôt enough to say something ‚Äúlooked better‚Äù, I had to explain why it worked, how it supported the concept, and how it would affect users.<br>
          It also taught me to balance empathy and creativity. Some ideas felt exciting visually, but didn‚Äôt really communicate the experience in the right way or worse, came across as too abstract or confusing. I had to learn when to let go of those and stay grounded in the purpose of the project.<br>
          Looking back, I‚Äôm proud that we didn‚Äôt just build a project that looked good, we created something based on real insights, made with real people in mind.<br><br>

      <h2>üì£ Feedback documentation in group project</h2>
      <p>
      We documented all teacher and client feedback in our Discord group and took time after each meeting to reflect together. We made actionable changes based on this feedback, such as simplifying the game interface, adjusting color contrasts, and making sure our tone stayed inclusive and professional.<br>

      <h2>üóÇ Trello contribution </h2>
      <p>
        As every project we created a Trello board to keep track of all the tasks and make sure there were deadlines. As the leader in the group Jerryl should make sure we make one I was there helping he wrote down everything. We worked in a team by dividing work and picking what time would work best for deadlines. We did not use it as much as I wanted to thru out the whole project but we still kept each other in track and got everything done on time, I believe that was achieved by us communicating well especially the last two/three weeks.<br>

      <h2 id="comments">üí¨ Comments And Iterations</h2>
      <p>
        In the beginning, I didn‚Äôt really see the use of adding comments in my code. But as the code became more complex, I started to find it really helpful, especially when there were multiple things happening at once, or when I was learning something new that I implemented but didn‚Äôt fully understand yet.<br>
        Writing comments helped me keep track of what each part did and made it easier to go back and fix things later.<br>
        <strong>When it comes to naming elements in my code</strong>, I try to keep things as clear and consistent as possible.<br>
        I usually name HTML and CSS classes based on their function or layout role, like top-bar, profile-info, or clickable-image‚Äîso it‚Äôs easy to recognize them at a glance.<br>
        For JavaScript, I use descriptive variable and function names that reflect what they do, such as updateClock, openApp, or getMaxZIndex.<br>
        I also break up the code into sections with small comments (as seen in the screenshots), to explain what's happening and to help both myself and others navigate the file more quickly.<br><br>
        Aside from coding, I actively participated in group decisions, brainstorming sessions, and UI feedback rounds. I frequently voiced ideas in Discord, helped choose images and icons for pages, and even assisted in copywriting content like buttons and headings to stay aligned with our tone of voice.<br><br>

      <h2 id="project-misread">üñ• Project Misread Development</h2>
      <p> 
        For my contributions to the project, I was responsible for developing the <strong>GameSetUp</strong> and <strong>Victory</strong> pages. 
        My strategy was to first build these pages using plain HTML and CSS, and then convert them into React components.<br><br> 
        Since I had no prior experience with React, I took time to research and understand it. I used ChatGPT to help explain core concepts and provide examples, which really helped me get started. I tried to implement everything on my own, but when I ran into issues, I reached out to Andy, who developed most of the base structure, for clarification.<br><br> 
        During development, I learned how to create sliders for selecting the number of rounds and setting the time limit. One of the most challenging parts was implementing the visual effects and making sure they matched Andy‚Äôs work while still understanding how everything functioned.<br><br> 
        Here are the original HTML and CSS versions of my pages: <br>

      <h2 id="portfolio-development">üñ• Portfolio Development </h2>
      <p> One of my favorite parts of my previous portfolio was the <strong>drawing page</strong> ‚Äî I really enjoyed working on it, and it helped me get more comfortable with creative coding.<br>
         üìé <a href="drawing.html" target="_blank">View Drawing Page</a><br><br>
         <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px;">
          <img src="function drawBackground.png" alt="function drawBackground" class="clickable-image" /> 
        </div>
        <strong>How it works:</strong><br>
        This function paints the whole background of the canvas with a smooth color gradient. It blends from pink to light green as you move across the screen.<br><br>
        <strong>Why I used it:</strong><br>
        I wanted the background to feel colorful and alive instead of just a solid color. It gives the page more energy and personality.<br><br>
        <strong>Where I learned it:</strong><br>
        I found how to use createLinearGradient() from W3Schools and some examples I saw on CodePen when exploring creative background effects.<br><br>
                
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px;">
          <img src="function render().png" alt="function render()" class="clickable-image" /> 
        </div>
        <strong>What it does:</strong><br>
        This function makes everything on the screen come alive. It keeps running over and over, updating the background and the glowing mouse trail every moment.<br><br>
        <em>Step by step:</em><br>
        - First, it clears the old stuff from the screen.<br>
        - Then it paints the colorful gradient background again.<br>
        - If the mouse has moved, it adds a glowing dot where the mouse is.<br>
        - It slowly makes the old dots fade away.<br>
        - Then it draws all the glowing dots that are still visible.<br>
        - Finally, it repeats the whole process, so it keeps running like an animation.<br><br>
        <strong>Why I used it:</strong><br>
        Without this, nothing would move. This is what makes the glowing trail follow the mouse and the whole page feel interactive and alive.<br><br>
        <strong>How I learned it:</strong><br>
        I saw examples online where people used requestAnimationFrame() to create smooth animations, and I wanted to try it myself!<br><br><br>

        For the other intresting page:<br>
        üìé <a href="flow.html" target="_blank">View Rainbow Flow Page</a><br>
        I had made mouse interactions before, but the new challenge was the background. I thought adding color would be easy, but it turned out to be much more complex than expected.<br><br>
        The background is created using WebGL shaders, which lets me control how every single pixel looks. There are two parts to it:<br>
        <em>Vertex Shader</em><br>
        Just sets up the screen area for drawing and it tells the browser: ‚Äúfill the whole canvas.‚Äù<br><br>

        <em>Fragment Shader</em><br>
        This is where the magic happens. The fragment shader uses math to:<br>

        - Make rainbow colors that smoothly change over time.<br>

        - Add swirl and wave effects so the background looks liquid-like and always moving.<br>

        - React to the mouse, making it glow more where the cursor is.<br><br>

        It runs on the canvas, and updates every frame (around 60 times per second), which is why the background looks alive and animated.<br><br><br>
        <strong>Developing the desktop version</strong> of my current portfolio was both fun and challenging. Trying to match the look and feel of real desktop apps for each learning outcome page was especially frustrating at times. Things often didn‚Äôt work on the first try, but I‚Äôm proud that I kept pushing through and didn‚Äôt give up.<br><br>
        When I upload my files to GitHub, I try to keep my commit messages short, clear, and focused on what the update actually does.<br><br>
        <strong>My strategy</strong> is to treat each commit like a summary of one meaningful change. I usually use present tense verbs and avoid generic messages like "update" or "fix" unless they‚Äôre followed by something specific.<br><br>
        For example:<br>
        - Add moodboard images to LO1 page<br>
        - Fix layout spacing on AboutMe section<br>
        - Update JavaScript to handle app z-index<br>
        - Improve stylescape link and image preview<br><br>
        If the commit includes small unrelated fixes, I‚Äôll write something like Minor fixes: spacing + icon alignment, but I try to keep each commit focused on one type of task.<br>
        I haven't used many commit comments because i used to write what i need to fix on the side in my Notes app, but after understanding it is important to add them, i started.

      <h2>üñ• Development Practices and Improvements</h2>
      <p>
        To improve the quality of our codebase, I began experimenting with code linters like Prettier to ensure consistent formatting across the team. I also discussed naming conventions and folder structure with teammates to keep everything organized.<br>
        We occasionally had code reviews by checking each other‚Äôs work before pushing to main, especially when it came to styling and interactions. I found that this helped me understand better ways of writing cleaner or more reusable code.<br>
        Finally, while our project doesn‚Äôt include automated testing, I‚Äôve learned about its importance and would like to integrate basic testing tools in future projects like Jest or Cypress to catch bugs earlier and validate user interactions.<br>
        I‚Äôve also want to start preparing a README.md file to explain how to run the website locally, the folder structure, and where to find key parts of the code. So this helps any  teacher quickly understand the project.<br>
