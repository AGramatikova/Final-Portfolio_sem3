      <h2>üé® Brand Guide Contribution</h2>
      <p>
        I contributed to several parts of our Brand Guide, especially the tone of voice, color palette decisions, and the icons & shapes page. These elements helped define how our brand looks, sounds, and feels‚Äîand we used them throughout our designs in Figma, the website, and our presentation materials.<br><br>
      </p>

        <h3>Color Palette</h3>
        <p>
          The color palette was a group effort. We had already chosen our main colors together as a team, but I helped finalize how they would be used across different elements. I focused on making sure the combinations had enough contrast for readability and accessibility. I checked how the colors worked in different backgrounds and tested them in real use (like buttons, text, and shapes) to make sure nothing got lost visually.<br>
          We made sure the palette reflected our tone: creative, soft, and playful, but still professional. We also looked at how the palette could layer well and work across both dark and light areas of the design.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Tone of Voice</h3>
        <p>
          I was responsible for writing the tone of voice section in the guide. I researched examples from real branding guides and adapted them to fit how we wanted to present ourselves: professional but friendly, creative but respectful.<br>
          I also wrote small examples of how this tone would show up across different platforms‚Äîwhether in emails, social media posts, or in the website itself. This made it easier for the whole team to stay consistent when writing anything for the project.<br><br>
        </p>

      <h3>Icons & Shapes Page</h3>
        <p>
          I helped Adeline with the icons and shapes section too. She designed the visuals, and I supported her by figuring out the rules for placement and spacing. We wanted to make sure the use of shapes didn‚Äôt feel random, so I helped define a simple structure‚Äîlike how far apart shapes should be spaced, how they should align, and how to keep everything consistent across screens. That structure helped turn a cool design into something usable and repeatable.<br><br>
        </p>

      <h3>Reflection:</h3><p>Working on the Brand Guide made me realize how much thought goes into the small stuff. I used to think brand design was mostly about picking colors and fonts, but I‚Äôve learned it‚Äôs way more layered than that. Every little thing‚Äîlike how shapes are placed or how friendly the writing sounds‚Äîcan shape how someone sees the whole project. I also saw how important it is to keep things clear and well-documented. Honestly, at first I wasn‚Äôt super confident writing the tone of voice section‚ÄîI kept wondering if it made sense to others or if I was overcomplicating it. But after sharing it with the group and seeing them actually use it, I felt more confident in what I wrote. Helping define the shape layout rules with Adeline also reminded me that structure can be creative too. Next time, I‚Äôd take more time to double-check how each decision fits into the bigger picture, instead of assuming it just ‚Äúworks.‚Äù This process helped me see how structured design thinking and feedback really improve the final result.</p>

      <h2>ü§ù Client Communication</h2>
      <p>
      Maintaining communication with the client was crucial. I stepped in to organize meetings when our team leader wasn‚Äôt available, directly messaging the client and coordinating availability. These efforts ensured we didn‚Äôt fall behind and had ongoing input and feedback from the client throughout.<br>

      <h2>üí° Double Diamond ‚Äì Krom Project</h2>
      <p>
        Together with Adeline, I was responsible for applying the Double Diamond design method to guide the structure of our Krom project. We wanted to make sure our design choices weren‚Äôt just based on what looked good, but on real needs, research, and testing. We combined the Double Diamond with CMD tools to explore the challenge in a structured and creative way.<br><br>
      </p>

        <h3>Discover</h3>
        <p>
          We started by interviewing Studio Krom to understand their goals and expectations. From there, we dove into research on dyslexia, especially how it affects reading and comprehension. We also looked into the target audience: people without dyslexia, but who would use our tool to experience what it feels like. That insight really helped shape how we framed the rest of the project.<br><br>
        </p>
        
        <h3>Define</h3>
        <p>
          In this phase, i created personas based on the audience we were designing for. We also mapped out the different types of dyslexia and explored how each could potentially be translated into a visual or interactive effect. This part was especially important, because we needed to make sure we were being accurate and respectful, not just creative. We made choices based on scientific sources.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Develop</h3>
        <p>
          Once we had a clear direction, we started experimenting with concepts. We tried different ways to visually simulate dyslexia, like distortion, word movement, spacing errors, and tested these internally to see which ones actually gave users that ‚ÄúI get it now‚Äù moment. We gathered feedback, made changes, and kept adjusting until the effects felt both impactful and understandable.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Deliver</h3>
        <p>
          We took the most effective concepts and turned them into a working prototype. We ran quick user tests to see how people responded. Did they understand the message, and did the experience actually make them reflect on what dyslexia feels like?<br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>My Role & Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          This whole process pushed me to justify both visual and technical decisions in a way I hadn‚Äôt done before. It wasn‚Äôt enough to say something ‚Äúlooked better‚Äù, I had to explain why it worked, how it supported the concept, and how it would affect users.<br>
          It also taught me to balance empathy and creativity. Some ideas felt exciting visually, but didn‚Äôt really communicate the experience in the right way or worse, came across as too abstract or confusing. I had to learn when to let go of those and stay grounded in the purpose of the project.<br>
          Looking back, I‚Äôm proud that we didn‚Äôt just build a project that looked good, we created something based on real insights, made with real people in mind.<br><br>

      <h2>üì£ Feedback documentation in group project</h2>
      <p>
      We documented all teacher and client feedback in our Discord group and took time after each meeting to reflect together. We made actionable changes based on this feedback, such as simplifying the game interface, adjusting color contrasts, and making sure our tone stayed inclusive and professional.<br>

      <h2>üóÇ Trello contribution </h2>
      <p>
        As every project we created a Trello board to keep track of all the tasks and make sure there were deadlines. As the leader in the group Jerryl should make sure we make one I was there helping he wrote down everything. We worked in a team by dividing work and picking what time would work best for deadlines. We did not use it as much as I wanted to thru out the whole project but we still kept each other in track and got everything done on time, I believe that was achieved by us communicating well especially the last two/three weeks.<br>

      <h2>üí¨ Comments And Iterations</h2>
      <p>
        In the begging I did not find use of adding comments in my code but recently I have been finding it helpful especially if there are a lot of stuff going on, or if I learned something new, implemented it but still had some trouble finding or fixing it correctly. Or just naming sections.<br>
        Aside from coding, I actively participated in group decisions, brainstorming sessions, and UI feedback rounds. I frequently voiced ideas in Discord, helped choose images and icons for pages, and even assisted in copywriting content like buttons and headings to stay aligned with our tone of voice.<br>
      </p>
    
      <hr class="section-divider" />

      <h2>üñ• Development Practices and Improvements</h2>
      <p>
        To improve the quality of our codebase, I began experimenting with code linters like Prettier to ensure consistent formatting across the team. I also discussed naming conventions and folder structure with teammates to keep everything organized.<br>
        We occasionally performed informal code reviews by checking each other‚Äôs work before pushing to main, especially when it came to styling and interactions. I found that this helped me understand better ways of writing cleaner or more reusable code.<br>
        Finally, while our project doesn‚Äôt include automated testing, I‚Äôve learned about its importance and would like to integrate basic testing tools in future projects like Jest or Cypress to catch bugs earlier and validate user interactions.<br>
        I‚Äôve also want to start preparing a README.md file to explain how to run the website locally, the folder structure, and where to find key parts of the code. So this helps any  teacher quickly understand the project.<br>
      </p>
    


      <h2>üîç Additional Value</h2>
      ‚úÖ <strong>Accessibility Consideration:</strong> I tried to reduce clutter, make text readable, and keep things simple for users with dyslexia.<br>
