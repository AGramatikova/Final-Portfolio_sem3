      <h2>üé® Brand Guide Contribution</h2>
      <p>
      I contributed directly to the Brand Guide, specifically:<br>
      ‚Ä¢	Color Palette: I selected colors that matched both accessibility needs and our artistic vision, balancing contrast and readability.<br>
      ‚Ä¢	Tone of Voice: I wrote the "Tone of Voice" page by researching online guidelines and tailoring them to how our group wanted to be perceived‚Äîprofessional but friendly, creative but respectful.<br><br>
      This brand identity was used consistently in our Figma files, interface designs, and website structure.<br>

      <h2>ü§ù Client Communication</h2>
      <p>
      Maintaining communication with the client was crucial. I stepped in to organize meetings when our team leader wasn‚Äôt available, directly messaging the client and coordinating availability. These efforts ensured we didn‚Äôt fall behind and had ongoing input and feedback from the client throughout.<br>

      <h2>üí° Double diamond project Krom document</h2>
      <p>
      Me and Adeline were responsible for applying the Double Diamond method to guide our design process. We began by researching the method and combining it with CMD tools to explore the challenge.<br>
      ‚Ä¢	In the <em>Discover</em> phase, we interviewed Studio Krom and conducted research to understand the target audience and their needs.<br>
      ‚Ä¢	In the <em>Define</em> phase, we created personas and research to better understand different types of dyslexia and how they could be represented in a digital format.<br>
      ‚Ä¢	During the <em>Develop</em> phase, we explored potential solutions and gathered user feedback to refine our ideas.<br>
      ‚Ä¢	In the <em>Deliver</em> phase, we prototyped our strongest concepts and tested them with real users.<br><br>
      This process required me to explain and justify technical and design decisions clearly, including why certain visual styles or mechanics would simulate dyslexic reading experiences effectively.<br>

      <h2>üì£ Feedback documentation in group project</h2>
      <p>
      We documented all teacher and client feedback in our Discord group and took time after each meeting to reflect together. We made actionable changes based on this feedback, such as simplifying the game interface, adjusting color contrasts, and making sure our tone stayed inclusive and professional.<br>

      <h2>üóÇ Trello contribution </h2>
      <p>
        As every project we created a Trello board to keep track of all the tasks and make sure there were deadlines. As the leader in the group Jerryl should make sure we make one I was there helping he wrote down everything. We worked in a team by dividing work and picking what time would work best for deadlines. We did not use it as much as I wanted to thru out the whole project but we still kept each other in track and got everything done on time, I believe that was achieved by us communicating well especially the last two/three weeks.<br>

      <h2>üí¨ Comments And Iterations</h2>
      <p>
        In the begging I did not find use of adding comments in my code but recently I have been finding it helpful especially if there are a lot of stuff going on, or if I learned something new, implemented it but still had some trouble finding or fixing it correctly. Or just naming sections.<br>
        Aside from coding, I actively participated in group decisions, brainstorming sessions, and UI feedback rounds. I frequently voiced ideas in Discord, helped choose images and icons for pages, and even assisted in copywriting content like buttons and headings to stay aligned with our tone of voice.<br>
      </p>
    
      <hr class="section-divider" />

      <h2>üñ• Development Practices and Improvements</h2>
      <p>
        To improve the quality of our codebase, I began experimenting with code linters like Prettier to ensure consistent formatting across the team. I also discussed naming conventions and folder structure with teammates to keep everything organized.<br>
        We occasionally performed informal code reviews by checking each other‚Äôs work before pushing to main, especially when it came to styling and interactions. I found that this helped me understand better ways of writing cleaner or more reusable code.<br>
        Finally, while our project doesn‚Äôt include automated testing, I‚Äôve learned about its importance and would like to integrate basic testing tools in future projects like Jest or Cypress to catch bugs earlier and validate user interactions.<br>
        I‚Äôve also want to start preparing a README.md file to explain how to run the website locally, the folder structure, and where to find key parts of the code. So this helps any  teacher quickly understand the project.<br>

      <h2>üîç Additional Value</h2>
      ‚úÖ <strong>Accessibility Consideration:</strong> I tried to reduce clutter, make text readable, and keep things simple for users with dyslexia.<br>
